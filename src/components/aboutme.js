            The name's Albert! I come from a retail background in
            telecomunications managing small and medium sized teams while
            exceeding all sales goals set for me. While thinking what to conquer
            next I decided I would follow something that made me happier early
            on in life and arrived at Wyncode.

          <h4>
            Here I was able to acquire the knowledge to become a Full Stack Web
            Developer. I found my love for coding during this time and even more
            the love for Front-End technologies. s
